GenAI Category 2. GenAI tools can   be   used   in an   assistive   role for   research. Students are   permitted to use GenAI tools   in a   limited,   critical   and   responsible way. The student should still be the author of their own work –   in   other words,   GenAI should   be limited to supporting and assisting the student   in   completing   the assessment, and should   not be completing the assessment   (entirely   or   only   in   part) on the student’s   behalf. Students   may   not use GenAI to   gain   unfair   academic advantage.
Coursework outline 
The   industries considered within this   module all   have a range of   unit   operations   and processes that transform   natural resources into   usable   products.
This coursework looks at questions, both   qualitative   and   quantitative   that   discuss   the refining of these   natural   resources   in the   mining and   nuclear sectors. You   must show your working out in each question to gain full   marks,   correct   answers will   only receive a single   mark without   it.
Please note. In order to randomise each of your coursework, each coursework will be linked to your student number, which is an eight-digit number;


The fourth and fifth digits correspond to XX, the sixth and seventh to YY and the eighth to W;
E.g.: 22163849; XX = 63 and YY = 84 and W = 9.
Please write your student number and the XX, YY and W values at the start of the coursework. 100 Marks Coursework – Part 1 In this part, we examine two different process flows for metalliferous ores: froth flotation and heap leaching/solvent extraction. Variations on these two processes are used to concentrate metals derived from their host minerals.
1) PROCESS MANAGEMENT 
a)    Why do we need to decrease   the   size   of our   ore   particles   down,   regardless   of whether we follow the froth flotation route, or the heap leaching/solvent extraction   route? (2 Marks) 
b)      If we are to follow the froth flotation route, what would be   an   appropriate   cut   size   be for our feed   particle size to fall below, and why?   Use an   example   to      help explain your answer. (3 Marks) 
2)    COMMINUTION MASS BALANCE The flow-rate of ore   into your comminution stage   is   1YY5 t   hr-1   . This ore   is   crushed, and then   milled. There   is a single stage of   milling, followed   by   a hydrocyclone. The   hydrocyclone underflow (particles that are too   large)   is      returned to the   mill.
2W % of the solids that leave the   mill   (and   enter the   hydrocyclone)   go   to   the underflow and are   recycled for further   milling.
a)      Draw the   process flow diagram. (4 Marks) 
b)    What is the total flowrate of solids through   the   mill?   Show   your working. (3 Marks) 
c)    What is   the   purpose   of the   hydrocyclone   in this   circuit? (2 Marks) 
d)    Would we   normally expect just one   mill and one hydrocyclone   at   a   mine   site?   Explain your answer. (3 Marks)
3) FROTH FLOTATION 
A bank of three flotation cells (as   part   of a   larger flotation facility)
cumulatively recovers a proportion of tin bearing   cassiterite   from   the   milled   ore.
a)    Calculate the cumulative grade-recovery from the following   data for   a   bank   of three flotation cells. The flotation feed rate is   1YY5 t   hr-1    solids, with   a grade of 0.5W % tin. You must show your calculations for the marks. 
Remember that grade   is the   proportion of metal   in ore   in this case,   and   recovery   is the   proportion of metal recovered to the   concentrate.

N.B., in reality, the tin bearing cassiterite is concentrated over numerous banks of cells that perform. different functions to maximise recovery. 
b)      Is your cumulative   recovery value realistic?   Explain you answer. (2 Marks) 
c)    A section of the   plant treats   160+XX0 t   hr-1   of ore   containing   0.W7   +   0.60   % tin (which is still associated with   cassiterite),   and   quartz-feldspar gangue. There are   no other minerals   in   the   ore.   The   plant can be operated   at   two   conditions: 
•          Condition   1: A tin   recovery of 8W %   and   a   concentrate   grade   of   38.1   %   (high grade, low   recovery).
•          Condition 2: A tin   recovery of 93   % and   a   concentrate   grade   of 2W.8   %   (low grade,   high   recovery).
The smelter pays 83 %   of the   market   price for the   mass   of tin   in the concentrate, and charges $代 写CENG0035 Minerals usage, extraction, and processing
代做程序编程语言   1200 per tonne of concentrate   as   a treatment   charge (for removing the associated gangue). The   current tin   price   is   $ 22500   per tonne.
Calculate:
i.               How   many tonnes of tin enter the   plant every   hour? (2 Marks) 
ii.             How   many tonnes   of tin   and total   concentrate   are   produced   every   hour for each of the two conditions? (4 Marks) 
iii.             What is   the   concentrate   value   per   hour for   each   of the two   conditions? (4 Marks) 
iv.             If   the tin price   increases   (say to $ 3W400 per tonne), should the plant   operate   at   a   higher   or   lower   recovery   condition?   Explain   and justify   your answer. (5 Marks) 
v.             In   terms   of   environmental   issues,   is   a   higher   tin   price   favourable   or   unfavourable?   Explain your answer. (2 Marks) 
4)    SOLVENT EXTRACTION 
A solvent extraction (SX) plant   comprises   1   extraction stage   and   1 stripping stage. The flowrate of pregnant leach solution   (PLS)   into   the      plant   is   1500   m3    hr-1   , with a Tin (Sn) content of   6   kg/m3    solution. The loaded electrolyte feed to the   EW   plant   has a Sn content   of 6W kg/m3   solution. The organic   phase consists of extractant   LIX900 in   kerosene.
a)       Draw the flowsheet and   label all   streams with   all   the   information   provided. (6 Marks) 
b)       The efficiency of the extraction stage   is   92-W %. The   ratio   of the   organic   phase (m3) to aqueous (m3) phase   across   the   extraction   stage   is   1.4:1.
An extractant, contained within   in the organic phase   is   used to   strip (collect) the tin from the   PLS. A   1 % solution of the   extractant   in the organic   phase can collect 0.1+0.XX kg Sn from the   PLS, for every 1 m3 of the organic phase. 
What   percentage concentration of extractant is required   in the   organic to   receive the tin transferring from the   PLS?
As part of your answer, you should calculate the volume   of the organic   phase. (5 Marks) 
c)       The depleted electrolyte from the   electrowinning   circuit   contains 40   kg   m3   solution. What is the flowrate of the loaded   electrolyte stream? (4 Marks) 
d)       What   happens to the tin   in the electrolyte solution?   Describe the   process   and the outcomes. (4 Marks) 64 marks in total for part 1
Coursework – Part 2 
In this part, we examine the production of nuclear power and the nuclear fuel cycle. 
1) NUCLEAR POWER 
a)    Write out the decay reaction series   for   uranium-235   going   through   one
stage of alpha (α) decay followed by   one   stage   of   beta   (β-)   decay. (1 Marks) 
b)      Describe the   process of producing uranium fuel from mined   uranium. (4 Marks) 
c)      Describe the   process of producing electrical energy from uranium fuel. (4 Marks) 
d)    Choose two of the aspects you   have described   in   parts   b)   and/or   c);

2)    URANIUM FUEL PRODUCTION 
The   burning of fuel   is   not   100 % efficient, a typical   reactor will   burn 7W %   of   the   U235    in the fuel, 2 % of the   U238      in the fuel will   also   be   burnt.   In this question consider a reactor that uses   uranium fuel with an   enrichment   of   2.1+0.YY % and a   tails   assay   of   0.25   %. 
a)      How   much   uranium feed to the enrichment   plant   is   required to   produce   1   kg of uranium   fuel? (3 Marks) 
b)    What   percentage of this uranium feed is   burnt for   conversion   into   electrical   power, assuming   no losses   in the fuel   rod fabrication? (3 Marks) 
c)      The   uranium deposit at Cigar Lake (Canada)   has   an   average   grade   of   15   %   U3O8   ,   how   much of this ore   needs to   be   mined for the   reactor to   have burnt   10   kg of uranium? (4 Marks) 
d)    Comment   on your   answer to   part   c). (1 Mark)
3)    NUCLEAR PLANT DESIGN AND SAFETY The   Finish company, TVO,   is considering restarting   plans to   build a fourth   reactor at Olkiluoto. The two designs currently under   consideration   for the   fourth   reactor are an   Evolutionary   Pressure Vessel   Reactor (EPR) and an   Advanced   Boiling Water Reactor (ABWR).
a)    Describe the technical similarities and   differences   between   these   two   reactors. (4 Marks) 
b)    Which of the two you think would be the   best   option for   TVO   and   why?   Consider financial, social and safety elements as well   as technical differences (8 Marks)
